# JSON methods, toJSON

Let’s say we have a complex object, and we’d like to convert it into a string, to send it over a network, or just to output it for logging purposes.

Naturally, such a string should include all important properties.

We could implement the conversion like this:

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  toString() {
    return `{name: "${this.name}", age: ${this.age}}`;
  }
};

alert(user); // {name: "John", age: 30}
```

…But in the process of development, new properties are added, old properties are renamed and removed. Updating such toString every time can become a pain. We could try to loop over properties in it, but what if the object is complex and has nested objects in properties? We’d need to implement their conversion as well.

Luckily, there’s no need to write the code to handle all this. The task has been solved already.

## JSON.stringify

The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a general format to represent values and objects. It is described as in RFC 4627 standard. Initially it was made for JavaScript, but many other languages have libraries to handle it as well. So it’s easy to use JSON for data exchange when the client uses JavaScript and the server is written on Ruby/PHP/Java/Whatever.

JavaScript provides methods:

-   JSON.stringify to convert objects into JSON.
-   JSON.parse to convert JSON back into an object.

For instance, here we JSON.stringify a student:

```javascript
let student = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: false,
  courses: ['html', 'css', 'js'],
  wife: null
};

let json = JSON.stringify(student);

alert(typeof json); // we've got a string!

alert(json);
/* JSON-encoded object:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isAdmin": false,
  "courses": ["html", "css", "js"],
  "wife": null
}
*/
```

The method JSON.stringify(student) takes the object and converts it into a string.

The resulting json string is called a JSON-encoded or serialized or stringified or marshalled object. We are ready to send it over the wire or put into a plain data store.

Please note that a JSON-encoded object has several important differences from the object literal:

-   Strings use double quotes. No single quotes or backticks in JSON. So 'John' becomes "John".
-   Object property names are double-quoted also. That’s obligatory. So age:30 becomes "age":30.

JSON.stringify can be applied to primitives as well.

JSON supports following data types:

-   Objects { ... }
-   Arrays [ ... ]
-   Primitives:
    - strings,
    - numbers,
    - Boolean values true/false,
    - null

For instance:

```javascript
// a number in JSON is just a number
alert( JSON.stringify(1) ) // 1

// a string in JSON is still a string, but double-quoted
alert( JSON.stringify('test') ) // "test"

alert( JSON.stringify(true) ); // true

alert( JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]) ); // [1,2,3]
```

JSON is data-only language-independent specification, so some JavaScript-specific object properties are skipped by JSON.stringify.

Namely:

-   Function properties (methods).
-   Symbolic keys and values.
-   Properties that store undefined.

```javascript
let user = {
  sayHi() { // ignored
    alert("Hello");
  },
  [Symbol("id")]: 123, // ignored
  something: undefined // ignored
};

alert( JSON.stringify(user) ); // {} (empty object)
```

Usually that’s fine. If that’s not what we want, then soon we’ll see how to customize the process.

The great thing is that nested objects are supported and converted automatically.

For instance:

```javascript
let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  room: {
    number: 23,
    participants: ["john", "ann"]
  }
};

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup) );
/* The whole structure is stringified:
{
  "title":"Conference",
  "room":{"number":23,"participants":["john","ann"]},
}
*/
```

The important limitation: there must be no circular references.

For instance:

```javascript
let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  participants: ["john", "ann"]
};

meetup.place = room;       // meetup references room
room.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup

JSON.stringify(meetup); // Error: Converting circular structure to JSON
```

## Summary
-   JSON is a data format that has its own independent standard and libraries for most programming languages.
-   JSON supports plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
-   JavaScript provides methods JSON.stringify to serialize into JSON and JSON.parse to read from JSON.
-   Both methods support transformer functions for smart reading/writing.
-   If an object has toJSON, then it is called by JSON.stringify.
